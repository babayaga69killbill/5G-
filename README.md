# 5G-
The generational evolution

## Standardization

Standardization in telecommunications aims to prevent this kind of problem. When every region develops its own communication technology, it leads to several issues:

Lack of Interoperability: Your phone wouldn't work if you traveled to a different country.

Increased Costs: It's expensive to design and maintain many different systems.

Slower Innovation: Without collaboration, the best ideas from around the world aren't pooled together to create the most efficient technology.

## The Key Players In 5G Standrdization

1. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)

    responsible for all matters related to information and communication technologies

   ###The 5G Requirements
   Peak Data Rate: This is the maximum theoretical speed a single device can achieve in perfect conditions. The target for **5G is 20 Gigabits per second (Gbit/s).**

User Experienced Data Rate: This is the average speed a user can realistically expect in a live network. The goal is to provide **100 Megabits per second (Mbit/s).**

Latency: This measures the delay, or lag, in the network. 5G aims for an extremely low latency of just **1 millisecond (ms)**, which is crucial for applications like real-time communication and autonomous vehicles.

Connection Density: This refers to the number of connected devices the network can support in a given area. 5G is designed to handle a massive **1 million connected devices per square kilometer.**

Mobility: The network must maintain a stable connection for users moving at high speeds. The requirement for 5G is to support seamless connectivity at speeds of up to **500 kilometers per hour (km/h).**

Network Energy Efficiency: This focuses on making the network more environmentally friendly by reducing power consumption. The goal for 5G is a **100-fold improvement in energy efficiency over 4G networks.**

Area Traffic Capacity: This measures the total data traffic the network can handle in a specific area. The target is **10 Megabits per second per square meter (Mbit/s/mÂ²).**

Spectrum Efficiency: This is a measure of how effectively radio frequency is used. 5G is designed to be significantly more efficient than 4G in how it uses the available spectrum.

## The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
the 3GPP figures out the how (the technology to meet those requirements). 3GPP is a global partnership of telecommunications standards organizations from different regions

Non Standalone(NSA):Non-Standalone (NSA) architecture involves the coexistence of both 4G and 5G network components. This approach allows operators to leverage their existing 4G infrastructure to roll out 5G services more quickly. 

Standalone(SA):A Standalone (SA) architecture uses a single generation of technology for both the radio access and the core network
