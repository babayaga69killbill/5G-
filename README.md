# 5G-
The generational evolution

## Standardization

Standardization in telecommunications aims to prevent this kind of problem. When every region develops its own communication technology, it leads to several issues:

Lack of Interoperability: Your phone wouldn't work if you traveled to a different country.

Increased Costs: It's expensive to design and maintain many different systems.

Slower Innovation: Without collaboration, the best ideas from around the world aren't pooled together to create the most efficient technology.

## The Key Players In 5G Standrdization

   ###The 5G Requirements
   Peak Data Rate: This is the maximum theoretical speed a single device can achieve in perfect conditions. The target for **5G is 20 Gigabits per second (Gbit/s).**

User Experienced Data Rate: This is the average speed a user can realistically expect in a live network. The goal is to provide **100 Megabits per second (Mbit/s).**

Latency: This measures the delay, or lag, in the network. 5G aims for an extremely low latency of just **1 millisecond (ms)**, which is crucial for applications like real-time communication and autonomous vehicles.

Connection Density: This refers to the number of connected devices the network can support in a given area. 5G is designed to handle a massive **1 million connected devices per square kilometer.**

Mobility: The network must maintain a stable connection for users moving at high speeds. The requirement for 5G is to support seamless connectivity at speeds of up to **500 kilometers per hour (km/h).**

Network Energy Efficiency: This focuses on making the network more environmentally friendly by reducing power consumption. The goal for 5G is a **100-fold improvement in energy efficiency over 4G networks.**

Area Traffic Capacity: This measures the total data traffic the network can handle in a specific area. The target is **10 Megabits per second per square meter (Mbit/s/mÂ²).**

Spectrum Efficiency: This is a measure of how effectively radio frequency is used. 5G is designed to be significantly more efficient than 4G in how it uses the available spectrum.

## The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
the 3GPP figures out the how (the technology to meet those requirements). 3GPP is a global partnership of telecommunications standards organizations from different regions
